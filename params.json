Please feel free to contribute to this Project.\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\nYou require the following to build Mango Pi:\r\n\r\n* Latest stable [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/)\r\n* Latest stable [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nNote that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 6 is enough to run your Mango Pi based application.\r\n\r\n## What will you find in this Project\r\n\r\nAs an attempt to create a library for the things that I often end up using in my projects, I started\r\nthe Mango Pi Project.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things you will find in Mango Pi\r\n\r\n* [ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/sohailalam2/Mango-Pi/tree/master/src/com/sohail/alam/mango_pi/algorithms)\r\n    * Round Robin - This will return an item from a List using Round Robin Algorithm\r\n\r\n* [JMX WRAPPER](https://github.com/sohailalam2/Mango-Pi/tree/master/src/com/sohail/alam/mango_pi/jmx/wrapper)\r\n    - Used for creating Dynamic MBeans with Annotations\r\n\r\n* [SMART CACHE](https://github.com/sohailalam2/Mango-Pi/tree/master/src/com/sohail/alam/mango_pi/smart/cache)\r\n    - A very simple in-memory caching system with auto-deletion features, event listener and more!\r\n\r\n* [UTILS](https://github.com/sohailalam2/Mango-Pi/tree/master/src/com/sohail/alam/mango_pi/utils)\r\n    - Various Utilities for common use\r\n\r\n* [VALIDATOR](https://github.com/sohailalam2/Mango-Pi/tree/master/src/com/sohail/alam/mango_pi/validator)\r\n    * IP Port - Validate IPv4, IPv6 and Port address. Extract IP, Port information from a String of IP:PORT pattern.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
