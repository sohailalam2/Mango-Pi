# Mango Pi Project

Mango Pi is a collection of Java Utility Classes that provide easy to use and easy to implement
functionality to the Java Developers.

It is an ongoing project. Please feel free to contribute to this Project.

## How to build

You require the following to build Mango Pi:

* Latest stable [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/)
* Latest stable [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

Note that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 6 is enough to run your Mango Pi based application.

## What will you find in this Project

As an attempt to create a library for the things that I often end up using in my projects, I started
the Mango Pi Project.

These are some of the things you will find in Mango Pi

* ALGORITHMS
    * Round Robin - This will return an item from a List using Round Robin Algorithm

* SMART CACHE - A very simple in-memory caching system with auto-deletion features, event listener and more!

* VALIDATOR
    * IP Port - Validate IPv4, IPv6 and Port address. Extract IP, Port information from a String of IP:PORT pattern.
